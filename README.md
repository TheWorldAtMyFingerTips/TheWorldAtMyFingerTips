# Portfolio
Hi there!

I'm Megan, a data analytics enthusiast.
I was previously in retail merchandising. While the bulk of my career was categorized as "merchandising", I find myself very drawn and fulfilled by the analytics part of merchandising. I'm fuelled by using data to simplify complexities into actionable insights. One thing led to another and now, I am currently pursuing an Associate Data Analyst course with NTUC LearningHub.
